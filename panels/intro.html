            <p>In view of the increasingly serious situation concerning the coronavirus in France, and the restrictions introduced by the French government, we are very sorry to have to announce the cancellation of the Paris Branch Weekend in Chambéry.</p>
            <p>Arrangements are being put in place to refund participants and we will aim to complete the process as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>We regret very much having to cancel our International Weekend, but we look forward to seeing you and to dancing with you again once this current crisis has passed.</p>
