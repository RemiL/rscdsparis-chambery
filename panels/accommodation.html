        <p>Vichy, being a popular spa town, offers numerous hotels both in the town itself and in the surrounding
          countryside.</p>
        <p>Note that Easter marks the beginning of the tourist season, so it is strongly recommended that you
          reserve hotel accommodation well in advance.</p>
